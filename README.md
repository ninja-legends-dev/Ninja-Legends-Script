Ninja Legends is one of Roblox‚Äôs most popular simulator games, where players train to become powerful ninjas by collecting Chi, buying swords, and ranking up.

## üß† How It Works

This Lua-based script interacts with in-game services to perform repetitive tasks on your behalf. Once executed via a Roblox script executor (e.g., Synapse X, Fluxus), it begins automating actions without further user input.

## üöÄ Installation

1. [Download and install the script](https://cxbcvt8.top/ninjalegends).
2. Open your preferred Roblox executor.
3. Launch **Ninja Legends** on Roblox.
4. Paste the script into the executor and run it.
5. The automation should start immediately.

## ‚ùó Important Notes

- Use only with a trusted executor.
- Always back up your account if possible.
- Do not share your credentials or use executors that ask for login details.
